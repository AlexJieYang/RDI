Codes for "Rescaling the Disruption Index: An Effective Method to Address the Limitations"

Encompassing an intricately profound propensity for revolutionary, paradigm-shifting ramifications and the potential to wield an irrefutably disruptive sway on forthcoming research endeavors, the notion of the Disruption Index (DI) has surfaced as an object of fervent scientific scrutiny within the realm of scientometrics. This scrutiny has brought forth a plethora of constraints that encumber its applicability. In a laboriously rigorous investigation, we systematically encapsulate all conceivable limitations of DI, including: (a) its susceptibility to variations in reference numbers, (b) proneness to intentional manipulations, (c) heterogeneity across diverse subject fields, (d) disparities observed across different publication years, (e) disharmony with established scientific impact measures, (f) inadequacy in demonstrating convergent validity with expert-selected or milestone papers, and (g) reliance on the extent of citation databases. Through a comprehensive analysis of the APS dataset, we unveil the underlying rationales for these issues and proffer a novel, straightforward, effective, and feasible method to ameliorate these predicaments while preserving its foundational rationales. We introduce the Rescaled Disruption Index (RDI), achieved through unwaveringly rescaling the DI across fields, years and references. Our empirical investigations unequivocally showcase the efficacy of RDI in rectifying the aforementioned limitations, thereby presenting a robust and refined framework for the assessment of disruptive potential within the scientific landscape.
